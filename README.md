## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Sometimes Swift wouldn't catch that I have already fixed an error. For example one time I wrote "let total = total.thousands()"
and it kept saying expecting "()" but all I did was hit the space bar right after the ")" and it dissapeared. I also encoutered an issue where my bill entry would crash the app, so in order to save time I just restarted.
